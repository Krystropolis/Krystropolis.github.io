    "journey": "My journey began with a degree in English Literature, fueled by a love of analysis and language. I wanted to teach at the high school level, because I believe deeply in the power of literacy and mentorship, but during my time as a teaching assistant, I witnessed systemic gaps that told me I needed to reevaluate where I could channel my love of critical thinking. Thankfully, a friend introduced me to programming in 2012. I began a second degree in Software Engineering in 2013, realizing that I could combine my love of language with technology. I knew that a career in Software Engineering would allow me to move to Europe, a decision I had made after a beautiful semester abroad in Ireland, and hoped to one day apply my skills to a value-aligned project with real world impact. After graduating, I spent 1 year in FinTech and 2 years with Disney, which felt like a dream come true! In 2020 I began a new chapter of life, temporarily trading in my keyboard for diapers, and in 2023 my family relocated to Germany from the USA. Now that we've settled in, bin ich bereit für mein nächstes Kapitel.",
