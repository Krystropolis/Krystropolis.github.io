From tinkering with robotics in the Makers Club to building production applications today, every step has been driven by a desire to learn and create. I studied in Ireland for four months, which gave me a global perspective that I bring to every project. Today, I'm focused on building meaningful software while continuing to grow as a developer and as a person.",
