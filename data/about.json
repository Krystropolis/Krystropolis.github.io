    "journey": "My journey began with a degree in English Literature, fueled by a love of analysis and language. I wanted to teach at the high school level, because I believe deeply in the power of literacy and mentorship, but during my time as a teaching assistant, I witnessed systemic gaps that told me I needed to reevaluate where I could channel my love of critical thinking. Thankfully, a friend introduced me to programming in 2012 and I have been hooked since. I decided to try again and started my Software Engineering degree in 2013. Software engineering feels like magic to me—I love bringing ideas to life with technology. As a purpose-driven individual, it is my hope to one day be a part of a team who builds something with real world impact. I have had a lot of interesting life experiences and every step has been driven by a desire to learn, create, and make a meaningful impact.",
