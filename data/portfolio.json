      "description": "I'm a Software Engineer by trade, but I always get really excited when I have the opportunity to tinker with hardware. Cue Brobot the Boe-Bot. I bought this robotics kit to become more familiar with embedded programming and robotics. Brobot uses a Parallax BASIC Stamp 2 microcontroller to interface with touch, light, and infrared sensors. These sensors help Brobot navigate his environment.",

My team participated in the Nittany Watson Challenge, creating a minimum viable product that would advance several rounds, and secure funding for further research and development. This is the current state of the project, which has had further development since my graduation, but retains many of the features and much of the knowledge added during my involvement.",

The first stage involved a GUI design and shape creation. The second stage entailed controlling shape movement and establishing bounds. The third stage required a slight redesign of the GUI because the initial dimensions given to us were incorrect. Finally, we worked on line clearing, shape rotation, and sound implementation. Correction: The final stage was competing to become the ultimate Tetris champion.",

Features include engaging responsiveness with a custom magnetic UI that mirrors the welcoming spirit of the New Year, accessibility-first design with support for prefers-reduced-motion, high-contrast text shadows, and semantic HTML structure, glassmorphism UI with backdrop-filter blur effects, and dynamic cultural integration with a Word of the Day feature cycling through traditional Chinese Chengyu idioms related to the Year of the Horse.",
