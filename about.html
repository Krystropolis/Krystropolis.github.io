If you're brand new to coding, I highly recommend Codecademy! They were my entry to programming (aside from learning HTML for my Neopets page). If you have a little more experience, take a look at Udemy. They have a lot of low cost courses.</div>

                <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">I am always interested in hearing about how I can help others. Most recently, I worked with Family Gateway (Dallas, Texas) and lead 12 of my coworkers in collecting funding and supplies to help displaced families. At the beginning of the school year, we contributed over 30 backpacks filled with supplies. For Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, we worked to contribute costumes, over 1 ton of food, and more than 100 toys. There is truly no greater feeling than that of improving the lives of those around you. If we haven't been the person in need, surely we have known them. I've been fortunate to have experienced kindness from so many others, it's only right that I give back.</div>
