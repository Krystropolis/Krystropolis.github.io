                <p>I'm a Software Engineer by trade, but I always get really excited when I have the opportunity to tinker with hardware. Cue <b>Brobot</b> the Boe-Bot. I bought this robotics kit to become more familiar with embedded programming and robotics. Brobot uses a Parallax BASIC Stamp 2 microcontroller to interface with touch, light, and infrared sensors. These sensors help Brobot navigate his environment.

                <p>My senior project focused on supervised machine learning, utilizing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/" target="_blank">IBM Watson</a> to create a virtual advisor who could assist prospective students with academic planning. My team participated in the <a href="https://www.edtechnetwork.psu.edu/news/nittany-watson-challenge-top-10-proposals">Nittany Watson Challenge</a>, creating a minimum viable product that would advance several rounds, and secure funding for further research and development.</p>
                <p>My former instructor, Mr. Ronald DelPorto, was kind enough to attend my capstone presentation and record part of it. During this presentation, I established a scenario to guide the audience through the use of our system.</p>

                <p>When I was in college, I started learning about front end frameworks. My professors recommended having a web presence, so I used <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to create a page with my at-the-time resume and some information pertaining to projects, classes, and interests.</p>

                    During senior year, I had an Embedded Systems course, in which I was to program <a href="https://krystropolis.blogspot.com/2017/04/united-blocks-of-america.html#more">Tetris</a>. We used QNX RTOS and C for this course. This was developed in several stages. The first stage involved a GUI design and shape creation. The second stage entailed controlling shape movement and establishing bounds. The third stage required a slight redesign of the GUI because the initial dimensions given to us were incorrect. Finally, we worked on line clearing, shape rotation, and sound implementation.<br/>Correction: The final stage was competing to become the ultimate Tetris champion.
